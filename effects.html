                Out of 24 parameters in the data fed to the model 12 of them have effect on customer churn
                probability. This means these are the variables that contribute in finding which customers will churn
                while all the other variables do not contribute so much. </li>

                The most effective parameter on customer churn is Offline Usage (hours per week). </li>

        <p class="help-p">If you click any of the variables from the right panel in Effects tab then you will be shown
            the group by Effect of the Target variable and the selected effective variable. The Group By is explained

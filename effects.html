                Out of 24 parameters in the data fed to the model 12 of them have effect on customer churn
                probability. This means these are the variables that contribute in finding which customers will churn
                while all the other variables do not contribute so much. </li>

                The most effective parameter on customer churn is Offline Usage (hours per week). </li>

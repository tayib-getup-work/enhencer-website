                Why do we need Group By and what is it in the first place?

                <br>
                <br>
                Let’s try to figure out; Does the age of the customer effect churn? In such a case our target variable
                is the Customer Status. Also remember that customer status has two distinct values, Churn & Retention,
                meaning a customer is either churned or not. Let’s choose Churn from the “Target Choice” dropdown.

                <br>
                <br>
                As the group by variable let’s choose “Age” from the drop-down menu. You will see age is divided into 3
                groups automatically by Enhencer. Enhencer does this to find the most optimal thresholds.

                <br>
                <br>
                On the left, you will see a stacked bar chart that displays the group by results.
                <br>
                <br>

                Notice the overall churn proportion in the data is 25%. It seems that customers aged between 52-68 are
                most likely to churn compared to other age groups.

                <br>
                <br>
                This is how Group By helps the user to see how one particular variable can affect their target variable.

            href="/segments.html">Enhance</a></b>
        function. The enthusiast users can experiment with the default settings of the algorithms, naturally expecting
        different results. Moreover, if the tree is unable to split with the default settings then one should change the
        settings from the Options.

            <b style="padding: 1px; border: 1px solid #259C8D; color:#259C8D;">Confidence Level</b> is
            the probability that the value of a selected variable falls within a specified range of values.

            This refers to the <b style="padding: 1px; border: 1px solid #259C8D; color:#259C8D;">Minimum leaf size</b>
            which is determined by default setting. However, the user can easily change the minimum segment size for the
            tree and segments functions. Doing so will update the tree and the user might obtain a different result than
            before.
        </li>
        <li><b style="padding: 1px; border: 1px solid #259C8D; color:#259C8D;">Maximum depth</b> is the number of nodes
            along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. In other words, this is the
            depth/height of the tree, this should neither be too small nor too large. The provided values are determined
            by the default setting which the user can change as they see fit.

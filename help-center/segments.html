            What all these mumbo-jumbo means in English is; We want to know which customers are more likely to become
            churn. The first segment contains 44 customers from the whole population with the highest lift of 4.01. Lift
            is explained below.

        <p class="help-p">The features are actually the effects of the other variables from the left panel on the target
            variable and these are obtained by the model.

            The lift 4.01 means that customers in the selected segment have a 4 times higher chance of becoming churn
            than the other customers. Lift is the multiplier for the segmentâ€™s distribution compared to average
            distribution. This means these 44 customers in this segment with the mentioned feature above has 100%
            possibility of becoming churn whereas in the overall population of 4000 customers have a 24.95% chance
            of becoming churn on average.

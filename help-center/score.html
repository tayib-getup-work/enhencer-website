                Users need to match significant variables to new data. This means each significant variable need to
                have a parallel new data variable.

                Sometimes the names can have slight differences like a space is missing or a character is extra or any
                kind of typo errors. In such cases just drag and drop the unmatched variables from the right side to
                the left side and it will be done. Once everything is set click “Apply” to start scoring the new data.

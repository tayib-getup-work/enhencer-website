    <p class="help-p">Predict screen is the place where you can score data using saved models, select different machine
        learning algorithms and export suitable predictive models to external platforms (currently Qlik script and SQL
        are supported).

    <p class="help-p">This is the Predict Screen of Enhencer, shown at the highlighted bar in the top section which is
        currently set on Predict. These are the basic explanations of the GUI;

    <ol class="help-p help-bullet-padding help-bullet-padding">
        <li>
            In Analyze Screen for a project, you can save multiple models. These models will appear in the Left Panel of
            Predict screen.

        <li>

        <li>
            Green highlighted one is currently being selected for prediction purpose.
        </li>

        <li>
            The right panel gives the user to implement and see the effects of different Machine Learning Modeling
            algorithms and compare their results for the best possible prediction.
        </li>
        <li>
            The middle panel shows the results of the chosen model and the model performances like lift, accuracy,
            scoring, etc.

        </li>
        <li>
            On the left are the model output options like accuracy, lift, and likelihood. On the right there are model
            options such as updating the model with different parameters, scoring new predictions and many more.

        </li>

    <h3 class="help-h3">Model Algorithms</h3>

    <p class="help-p"> <br>On the right panel, Enhencer provides different Machine Learning Modelling algorithms that
        users can choose from. Currently, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XG Boost algorithms are available, however,
        many other algorithms will be ready to use very soon.
    </p>


    <p class="help-p"> <br>Also, users can tweak the primary settings of the model algorithms from the right side. For
        instance, under Decision Tree, there is Minimum Leaf Size and Maximum Depth options that can be changed to see
        how model performance is affected. You can play with the settings and choose the best options for the model
        performance.

        <p class="help-p">Both Likelihood and What If correspond to the same purpose of conditioning and predicting a
            new phenomenon. In other words, try to ask what if a new male customer with an age of 34 with negative
            credit history comes to withdraw a loan, what are the chances that he would become fraud or churn? Thatâ€™s
            the kind of questions you can ask to your data using What-If or Likelihood task.

        <p class="help-p">In what if, you can select variable values and ranges to understand the predicted probability
            of the target value.

                Clicking both Likelihood & What-If will get the important variables listed for the model in the right

            <li>
                Right panel holds the variable which the model finds significant and important for the target variable
                and the variables are listed from the highest important/significant to the lowest.

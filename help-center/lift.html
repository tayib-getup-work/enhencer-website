            Lift and Adjust corresponds to the same output section. They both allow users to adjust and see the captured
            responses and lift that the model is providing.
        </li>
        <li>
            “Counts of Target Choice” box represents the captured response analysis for the model. It is explained below
            here.</li>

        <li>“Proportion of Target” Choice box provides the lift analysis for the selected model.
        </li>
        <li>The large dots represent the proportion of data that is chosen to observe both Captured responses and the
            Lift. You can easily increase or decrease the cutoff threshold by clicking Plus and Minus buttons to see the
            changes happen.

            The Lift above shows that if you sort predictions from highest to lowest and get top 25% of the predictions,
            the average customer churn in the top 25% is 74.3% compared to overall 25% which corresponds to a lift of
            2.98. In other words, the top 25% proportion of the data has a churn rate of 74.3% which is 2.98 times
            higher than the overall population proportion. If you change the cutoff thresholdt across the line graph you
            will observe different lifts for different selected proportions.</p>

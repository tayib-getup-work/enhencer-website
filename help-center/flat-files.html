    <p class="help-p">Flat files are terms to describe a group of data formats. The group includes;
        <b>Comma Delimited (.csv) and Text Files (.txt).</b> If your data is in one these formats please choose the flat
        files option from the list in the design screen.
        <br>

        Example of a excel file:

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="help-p">This is one example of Excel <b>(xlsx & .csv)</b> file. This file represents customer records of a
        company, specifically for a subscription-based product, which customers have left the company (churn) or not
        (retention). While preparing the data for uploading or analyzing, please make sure your data meets the following
        conditions;
    </p>
    <ol class="help-p help-bullet-padding help-bullet-padding">
        <li>
            Column header cannot be blank. Please note that there can be missing values in the data but specifically,
            column name cannot be missing/blank.
        </li>
        <li>
            The characters used in the data should be Latin only, meaning all the other characters sets from other
            languages will have to be changed. For instance, Öö, Ğğ or similar different characters can cause problems
            in the analysis phase.
        </li>
        <li>Lastly, please make sure there is no blank space at the very bottom of the file and at the rightest side of
            the last column. </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="help-p">This is an example of Text <b>(.txt)</b> file; it is looking quite chaotic as a file and not much
        can be understood by looking at it but upload it to Enhencer, it will take care of the rest and you can go
        straight to the analysis phase.

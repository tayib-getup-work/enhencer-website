        The report page should look something like this. Left panel holds all the reports the user saved over time. One
        very important feature about reports is that the user can not change the results of any analysis or mode, user
        can only view them in different visualization options available.

            Notice how many tasks like filter, group by, select etc. are missing. This is because Report page only
            allows users to view the results and doesnâ€™t allow to make any changes to the analyses. </li>

            Why do we need a group by and what is it ain the first place?
            <br>
            <br>
            Lets try to figure out does the age of the customers effect in any way in becoming churn. In such a case
            our target variable is the Customer Status. Also remember that customer status has two distinct values,
            Churn & Retention meaning a customer either become churn or not. Thus lets choose Churn from the <b>“Target
                Choice”</b> dropdown.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the group by variable lets choose <i>“Age”</i> from the drop down menu. You will see age is devided into
            3
            groups automatically by Ehencer. Enhencer does this to find the most optimal thresholds.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the left you will see a stacked bar chart that displays the group by results.
            <br>
            <br>

            Notice the overall churn proportion in the data is 25%. It seems customer aging between 52-68 are most
            likely to become churn compared to other age groups.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is how group by helps user to see how one particular variable can effect their target variable.

            <br>
            <br>
            The overall churn rate in the population is 24.95% and we are trying to observe what is the churn rate for
            the customers who are divorced. After filtering the data, it seems like the churn rate is 22.75% for the
            customers who are divorced which is lower than the overall population.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is how filter can actually be used in analysis phase and how it should be interpreted.

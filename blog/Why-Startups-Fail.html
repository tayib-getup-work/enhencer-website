                                            Without correct anticipation of the target audience and correct ways of
                                            reaching that audience, said product is destined to fail as well as the

                                            perspective of customer since the quality goes up, prices go down, and
                                            customer feel like s/he is the center of the world. However, from enterprise
                                            side, an overdose competition is deadly. Startups’ nature does not compel a

                                    all an enterprise need. If the prediction tools and strategy modelling are
                                    consistent, a startup would find its way up to million-dollar league.

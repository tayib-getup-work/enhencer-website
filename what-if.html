        <p class="help-p">Both likelihood and What If corresponds to the same purpose of conditioning and predicting a
            new phenomenon. In other words, try to ask what if a new male customer of age 34 with negative credit
            history comes to withdraw a loan, what are the chances that he would become fraud or churn? Thatâ€™s the kind
            of questions you can ask to your data using What-If or Likelihood task.</p>

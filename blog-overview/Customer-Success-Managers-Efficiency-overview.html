                                    single idea. End-product is served to customers and they left alone. Thus, the
                                    ongoing process of customer usage cannot be measured as well as the turn rates of
                                    unsuccessful customers. In order to endorse turn retention, the new method of
                                    marketing/PR is called customer success.

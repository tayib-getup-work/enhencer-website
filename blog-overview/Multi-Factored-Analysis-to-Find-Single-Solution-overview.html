            <p class="mb-3">In its mathematical meaning, the factor analysis is something about
                reducing and abbreviating the variables of the problem to reach the ultimate answer.
                Answer itself sometimes is more complicated than the initial problem. However, using
                a good methodology in statistics helps a lot to tackle this problem of intrinsic
                complication.

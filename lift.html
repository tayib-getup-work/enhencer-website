            Lift and Adjust corresponds to the same output section. The both allow users to adjust and see the
            captured responses and lift that the model is proposing.</li>
        <li>
            “Counts of Target Choice” box represents the captured response analysis for the model. This is explained
            below here.</li>

        <li>“Proportion of Target” Choice box provides the lift analysis for the selected model.</li>
        <li>The large dots represent the proportion of data that is chosen to observe both Captured responses and
            the Lift. You can easily drag the large point across the point line in the graph to see the changes happens
            when selecting a different proportion of data. </li>

            Captured Responses:
            <br>
            The Lift above shows that if you sort predictions from highest to lowest and get top 25% of the
            predictions, the average customer churn in the top 25% is 74.3% compared to overall 25% which corresponds
            to a lift of 2.98. In other words, the top 25% proportion of the data has churn rate of 74.3% which is 2.98
            times higher than the overall population proportion. If you move the large point across the line graph you
            will observe different lifts for different selected proportions.</p>

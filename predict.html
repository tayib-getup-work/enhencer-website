    <p class="help-p">Predict screen is the place where you can score data using saved models, select different machine
        learning algorithms and export suitable predictive models to external platforms (currently Qlik script and SQL
        are supported).</p>

    <p class="help-p">This is the Predict Screen of Enhencer, you can understand in which page and task you are by
        looking at the highlighted bar in the top section which is currently set on Predict. These are the basic
        explanations of the GUI;</p>

    <ol class="help-p help-bullet-padding help-bullet-padding">
        <li>
            In Predict Screen for a project, you can save multiple models. These models will appear in the Left
            Panel of Predict screen. <li>

        <li>
            Green highlighted one is currently being selected for prediction purpose.</li>

        <li>
            The right panel gives the user to implement and see the effect of different Machine Learning Modelling
            algorithms and compare their result for the best possible prediction possible. </li>
        <li>
            The Middle panel shows the results of the chosen model and the model specification like life, accuracy,
            scoring etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the left: These are the model output options like accuracy, life and likelihood. On the Right: These
            are model options like updating model with different parameter, scoring new predictions and many more.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="help-p">All these are explained in detailed manner in next segments.

    <h3 class="help-h3">Model Algorithms</h3>

    <p class="help-p"> <br>On the right panel Enhencer provides the different Machine Learning Modelling algorithms
        that users can choose from. Currently 0nly Decision Tree is available to implement, however, all the other
        model algorithms will be ready to use very soon. </p>


    <p class="help-p"> <br>Also, users can tweak the primary settings of the model algorithms from the right side. For
        instance, under Decision Tree there is Minimum Leaf Size and Maximum Depth options that can be changed to see
        how the model will perform for predictions. Just play with the settings and choose the best options that
        defines the data best. </p>
